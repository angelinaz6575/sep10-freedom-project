# Choosing a topic

<p> The topic I decided on for this project was business fields because I've always been dreaming about working in a business. In a company, start my own company, doesn't matter. I've been interested in this since when I was in 7th or 8th grade. At first, I really didn't know why I wanted to purse business careers, but it was just in my mind and I couldn't shake it off. My family runs their own business, and I was somehow interested in that, so I wanted to purse in business fields. I want to incorporate technology into business fields. I took consideration in making this project about sports, and culinary, but I felt like business would be the best. Some of the articles include 【The Impact of Emerging Technology in Sports] (https://www.ohio.edu/business/academics/graduate/professional-master-sports-administration/resources/technology-sports, by Ohio University college of business, and【Culinary Evolution: The Impact of Technology on Food Preparation】https://daxcooke.net/culinary-evolution-the-impact-of-technology-on-food-preparation/ by Jonathan Dax Cooke. The one that interest me the most is 【The Intersection of Business and Technology】https://online.marymount.edu/blog/intersection-business-and-technology by Marymount University. Technology could incorporate in business in any ways, which made me fansinated and more passionate about business.</p>


# Engineerng Design Process
<p>The first part of engineering design process is to figure out the problem that I would hope to solve in my project, which is how network outages disrupt productiviy. The next step of the design process is to research the problem, and talk to my peers, or search on google, or any reliable sources I can use to find on the internet, about solutions for the issue that could work to help the business field with better technology.</p>


# Skills
<ul>
  <li> <h3>Time Management </h3> </li>
</ul>

<p> I'm pretty busy right after school since I'm on the HSTAT girls varsity volleyball team, I have practice every single day and games every week. So, basically means I don't really have enough time to do all my homeworks, project, or studying for test. Right after I go home and do my routine. I mainly get home around somewhere at 6-8 PM for different reasons. But still, I come back late and I ended up figuring out how to split my time on each work efficiently. I focus on one subject, for a good amount of time, and do the next one with the same amount of time. After I go through every work I have to do, most of it is pretty much done. Sometimes I may finish early and still have time before I need to get ready to sleep, I go back to the homework's that I didn't finish, or close to finish, and continue it so I could save myself more time the next day. Usually, I usually always go straight to playing my videogames as soon as I get home, but I cut off videogames and focus on my school work since I am becoming busier day by day. Having the videogames cut off really helped me to stay on task with my work, and not gettinf distracted. </p>

<ul>
  <li> <h3> Googling </h3> </li>
</ul>

<p> Whenever I go on the internet to google for something or for answers, I don't randomly go to a random website, or look at all links that pops up. Instead, I find it helpful to read the titles and the description of the website to find what I'm searching for. Seeing actually good intentional website title and descriptions makes me choose the website to use to find answers since it's more reliable. Titles like <a href ="#"> The Intersection of Business and Technology> </a> https://online.marymount.edu/blog/intersection-business-and-technology is a good example of a good title to look at, instead of other titles which may say "(#) why ....." or a long title name with parenthesis. </p>
