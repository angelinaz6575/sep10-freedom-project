### Content

The software and hardware technologies that I found in my topic were Customer Relationship Management, Accounting software, Portable projectors, and pen scanners. 

* Customer Relationship Management is a software that helps business companies made loyal customer relationships.
* Accounting software is to help keep track of things like incomes, expenses, or transactions.
* Portable projector is a gadget used in business which is very easy for transporting, and it really helps projects your idea to group of people.
* Pen scanners can help translate multi-languages, text to speech function, and can even work offline without any wifi

 I searched up "Technologies in business" and that's where I found the software to my topic, but nothing really for gadgets. Instead I changed my searches to "Gadgets in business" which showed me the items that people in the business field use to help them.

 ### Engineering Design Process

I already finished the first part of the process, which is determining the problem. The problem is network outages disrupt productivity. Now I am on the 2nd step of the process which I need to research the problem. Network outages disrupt productivity because empployees can loose their access or file thats needed to perform their jobs. Communication are also cut off because they can't communicate with each other. The inability to work together efficiently can cause fustration among the workers which will make them slack off and unfocused when their is a network outage. 

## Skills

### Time Management
I'm always busy afterschool especially during the first 3 months of school because I am in the HSTAT girls volleyball team. Being in a team really take up a lot of homework time because there is always practices afterschool for like 3 hours. Throughout the month we have our season games too, which we get home late or early depending on the game. Then, I have a lot of homework to do right when I get home. I distribute my time evenly so each of my homework can have some progress done, or to be completed.
