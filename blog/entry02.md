### Content

The software and hardware technologies that I found in my topic were Customer Relationship Management, Accounting software, Portable projectors, and pen scanners. 

* Customer Relationship Management is a software that helps business companies made loyal customer relationships.
* Accounting software is to help keep track of things like incomes, expenses, or transactions.
* Portable projector is a gadget used in business which is very easy for transporting, and it really helps projects your idea to group of people.
* Pen scanners can help translate multi-languages, text to speech function, and can even work offline without any wifi

 I searched up "Technologies in business" and that's where I found the software to my topic, but nothing really for gadgets. Instead I changed my searches to "Gadgets in business" which showed me the items that people in the business field use to help them.
